\section{Model}

Our model is inspired by Fily \textit{et al.} \cite{fily2012athermal, fily2014freezing}. It was chosen both for its simplicity, which should guarantee a quick implementation and an easy replication of results, and for the interesting phenomena it should display according to the aforementioned papers.

\subsection{System}

Our system is two-dimensional and composed of $N$ disks in a square box of length $L$. To avoid crystallisation, we uniformly distribute particles radii, $(a_i)_{1 \leq i \leq N}$, in the interval $[(1-I)a; (1+I)a]$, with $a$ the mean radius and $I$ the polydispersity index, and fix $I=20\%$. From these, we obtain the system packing fraction $\phi = \sum_{i=1}^N \pi a_i^2/L^2$.\\

We impose Brownian dynamics (\textit{i.e.}, we neglect inertia) so that the equation of motion of a single particle is given by
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt}\vec{r}_i(t) = \mu \sum\vec{F}_i(t)
\label{brownian_dynamics}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{r}_i(t)$ is the radius vector of particle $i$ as a function of time $t$, $\mu$ is the mobility, and $\sum\vec{F}_i(t)$ is the sum of forces applied on particle $i$ at time $t$.

\subsection{Interparticle interaction}

Particles interact through a purely repulsive pairwise interparticle harmonic potential, such that the force exerted on particle $i$ by particle $j$ is
\begin{equation}
\vec{F}_{ij}(t) = k(a_i + a_j - ||\vec{r}_i(t) - \vec{r}_j(t)||)\frac{\vec{r}_i(t) - \vec{r}_j(t)}{||\vec{r}_i(t) - \vec{r}_j(t)||}
\label{interparticle_force}
\end{equation}
where $k$ is equivalent to a spring constant.\\

This interparticle potential is particularly soft -- so soft that it theoretically enables particles to go through each others -- and it might seem more appropriate to use harder potentials -- with forces which diverge as the distance between particles goes to 0. However, it has been noted by the authors of \cite{fily2014freezing} that such a change affects only qualitatively the collective behaviour of particles. We then keep this potential for its simplicity.\\

Purely repulsive harmonic potentials, initially proposed by Durian \cite{durian1995foam} to study foam dynamics, have also been extensively used in numerical studies of the jamming transition of athermal frictionless granular materials \cite{o2003jamming, olsson2007critical}.

\subsection{Self-propulsion mechanism}
\label{subsection:self_propulsion_mechanism}

We introduce for each particle $i$ a self-propulsion force
\begin{equation}
\vec{F}^{(sp)}_i(t) = \frac{\vec{v}_i(t)}{\mu} = \frac{v_0}{\mu}\vec{n}_i(t) = \frac{v_0}{\mu}\begin{pmatrix}\cos\theta_i(t)\\\sin\theta_i(t)\end{pmatrix}
\label{self_propulsion}
\end{equation}
where $v_0$ is the single-particle self-propulsion speed.\\

We then control the angular dynamics of particle $i$ with a Gaussian white rotational noise $\eta_i(t)$ such that
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt}\theta_i(t) = \eta_i(t);~ \left<\eta_i(t)\eta_j(t^{\prime})\right> = 2\nu_r\delta_{ij}\delta(t - t^{\prime})
\label{rotational_noise_correlation}
\end{equation}
where $\left<\ldots\right>$ denotes an ensemble and time average, and $\nu_r$ is the rotational diffusion rate. This model of active Brownian particles \cite{romanczuk2012active} describes the behaviour of active colloids used in experiments \cite{buttinoni2013dynamical, howse2007self, bialke2015active, theurkauff2012dynamic}.\\

What equations \ref{self_propulsion} and \ref{rotational_noise_correlation} describe is a persistent random walk. Particles are propelled in a direction which decorrelates smoothly via rotational diffusion with rotational diffusion rate $\nu_r$ \cite{cates2015motility}. Qualitatively, we can give the following representation to ourselves: particles follow straight lines for a time $\tau_r \equiv \nu_r^{-1}$, which is the persistence time, and then change direction at random (see Figure \ref{persistent_random_walk}).\\

It is noteworthy that at low persistence time $\tau_r \rightarrow 0$ (\textit{i.e.}, $\nu_r \rightarrow +\infty$), this self-propulsion mechanism becomes equivalent to thermal agitation \cite{fily2014freezing}.\\

\label{msd_ensemble_fit}
\end{figure}

With $\vec{r}(t)$ the radius vector of a single particle as a function of time, we define the mean square displacement as
\begin{equation}
\left<|\Delta\vec{r}(t)|^2\right> = \frac{\int dt^{\prime}~ ||\vec{r}(t^{\prime} + t) - \vec{r}(t^{\prime})||^2}{\int dt^{\prime}}
\label{msd}
\end{equation}
and then introduce the diffusion constant $D_0 = v_0^2/2\nu_r$ such that a single particle performing a persistent random walk described by equations \ref{self_propulsion} and \ref{rotational_noise_correlation} has the following mean square displacement at any time $t$ \cite{fily2012athermal}
\begin{equation}
\left<|\Delta\vec{r}(t)|^2\right> = 4D_0\left(t + \frac{1}{\nu_r}\left(e^{-\nu_rt}-1\right)\right)
\label{msd_prw}
\end{equation}
in which we observe
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\left<|\Delta\vec{r}(t)|^2\right> \underset{t \rightarrow 0}&{\sim} 4 D_0 \nu_r t^2 &&\Rightarrow \text{ballistic regime}\\
\left<|\Delta\vec{r}(t)|^2\right> \underset{t \rightarrow +\infty}&{\sim} 4 D_0 t &&\Rightarrow \text{diffusive regime}
\end{aligned}
\label{msd_prw_limit}
\end{equation}
showing that the displacement of the particle is diffusive at high times and with a diffusion constant which increases with increasing persistence time $\tau_r$ (\textit{i.e.}, with decreasing rotational diffusion rate $\nu_r$).\\

This theoretical expression of the mean square displacement gives us a first quick way to test the correct implementation of our model. Indeed, for a low enough packing fraction $\phi$, particles should hardly interact with each others. We should thus have that the ensemble mean square displacement
\begin{equation}
\left<|\Delta\vec{r}(t)|^2\right> = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \int dt^{\prime}~ ||\left(\vec{r}_i(t^{\prime} + t) - \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N\vec{r}_j(t^{\prime} + t)\right) - \left(\vec{r}_i(t^{\prime}) - \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N \vec{r}_j(t^{\prime})\right)||^2}{N \int dt^{\prime}}
\label{msd_ensemble}
\end{equation}
is given by equation \ref{msd_prw}. We see in figure \ref{msd_ensemble_fit} that the theoretical expression in great accordance with the numerical result, hence indicating a correct implementation.

\subsection{Equation of motion and control parameters}

From equations \ref{brownian_dynamics}, \ref{interparticle_force} and \ref{self_propulsion}, we can now write the equation of motion of particle $i$
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt}\vec{r}_i(t) = \mu\left(\vec{F}_i^{(sp)}(t) + \sum_{j \neq i} \vec{F}_{ij}(t)\right) = \underbrace{v_0\vec{n}_i(t)\vphantom{\frac{\vec{r}_i(t) - \vec{r}_j(t)}{||\vec{r}_i(t) - \vec{r}_j(t)||}}}_{\displaystyle\text{self-propulsion}} + \underbrace{\mu k (a_i + a_j - ||\vec{r}_i(t) - \vec{r}_j(t)||)\frac{\vec{r}_i(t) - \vec{r}_j(t)}{||\vec{r}_i(t) - \vec{r}_j(t)||}}_{\displaystyle\text{interparticle interaction}}
\label{equation_motion}
\end{equation}
which we implement in our simulations.\\

We finally highlight the 3 control parameters of our model system \cite{fily2014freezing}:
\begin{itemize}
\item the packing fraction $\phi$,
\item the dimensionless self-propulsion velocity $\tilde{v} = v_0/ak$,
\item and the dimensionless rotational diffusion rate $\tilde{\nu}_r = \nu_r/k$ or equivalently the persistence time $\tau_r = \tilde{\nu}_r^{-1}$,
\end{itemize}
to which we will refer throughout this report.\\

An additional useful quantity is the dimensionless P\'eclet number, $\text{Pe} = \tilde{v}/\tilde{\nu}_r = \tilde{v}\tau_r$, which quantifies the dimensionless distance travelled by a single particle before its self-propulsion orientation decorrelates.

\section{Integration method}

Simulations were perfomed with the HOOMD-blue molecular dynamics simulation toolkit \cite{hoomd, anderson2008general, glaser2015strong, phillips2011pseudo} on Python \faPython. This toolkit was chosen for its high perfomance on GPUs, its versatility, and its ease of use. Our simulation script is available at \href{https://github.com/yketa/active_particles/blob/master/simulation/collective_migration_DPD_polydisperse_active.py}{{\faGithub~ yketa/active\_particles/simulation/collective\_migration\_DPD\_polydisperse\_active.py}}.

\myparagraph{Initialisation}

After setting the mean radius of particles $a = 1$, we choose the number $n_s$ of different radii to be taken uniformly in the interval $[0.8; 1.2]$. As the algorithm runs slower with increasing $n_s$, we set $n_s = 10$ and then attribute to each particle one of these different radii. We choose the packing fraction $\phi$ and then set the length $L$ of the square box accordingly.\\

We start by positioning particles randomly in the system box. We then use the Fast Inertial Relaxation Engine (FIRE) algorithm \cite{bitzek2006structural} to decrease particles' interpenetrations.

\myparagraph{Integration}

We set periodic boundary conditions and make use of the Brownian integrator as well as the active force functionality of HOOMD-blue for integration of equation \ref{equation_motion}.
