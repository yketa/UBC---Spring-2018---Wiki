# Simple model of active particles
### Yann-Edwin Keta, University of British Columbia, 2018

This project was started at the University of British Columbia, under the supervision of Joerg Rottler, during the Spring 2018. It focuses on a model system of polydisperse active Brownian disks with purely repulsive interparticle harmonic potential, inspired by  [Fily et al., 2014](http://pubs.rsc.org/-/content/articlelanding/2014/sm/c3sm52469h/). This model system displays motility-induced phase separation and shows cooperative motion correlated over large distances and periods of time, which we aim to characterise.

This wiki contains presentations of our model and methods, as well as figures, images, videos and remarks about our results.

It can be read via this project [GitHub page](https://yketa.github.io/UBC_2018_Wiki), or by cloning this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yketa/UBC_2018_Wiki
```
and opening the `index.html` file.
```bash
xdg-open UBC_2018_Wiki/index.html  # on Linux
open UBC_2018_Wiki/index.html      # on MacOS X
```

All the code developed during this project, for simulation and analysis purposes, is available at the respository [yketa/active_particles](https://github.com/yketa/active_particles).
